I am Master's student, in [Seminar for Statistics](https://math.ethz.ch/sfs), at [ETH Zurich](http://www.ethz.ch/en.html), majoring in Statistics. My interests are Computer Vision, Reliable Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning.

I am currently being advised by [Prof. Luc van Gool](https://ee.ethz.ch/the-department/faculty/professors/person-detail.OTAyMzM=.TGlzdC80MTEsMTA1ODA0MjU5.html) on my thesis project. Previously, I earned BS-MS (dual degree) in Mathematics and Scientific Computing at [IIT Kanpur](www.iitk.ac.in), where I was advised by [Prof. Debasis Kundu](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=yq8z1rIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) on Bayesian modeling. During my studies, I have worked on Natural Language Processing, Boosting Machines and Topic Modeling.
